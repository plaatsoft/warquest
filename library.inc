The High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV), better known as the Humvee, is a military 4WD motor vehicle created by AM General. 
It has largely supplanted the roles formerly served by smaller Jeeps such as the M151 1/4-short-ton (230 kg) MUTT, the M561 "Gama Goat", 
their M718A1 and M792 ambulance versions, the CUCV, and other light trucks. Primarily used by the United States Armed Forces, it is also 
used by numerous other countries and organizations and even in civilian adaptations. The Hummer series was also inspired by the HMMWVs.<br/><br/>

<span class="subparagraph2">Features:</span><br/>
Humvee uses independent suspensions and portal geared hubs similar to portal axles to make for a full 16 inches of ground clearance. The 
vehicle also has disc brakes on all 4 wheels, and 4-wheel double-wishbone suspension. The brake discs are not mounted at the wheels as on 
conventional automobiles, but are inboard, attached to the outside of each differential. The front and rear differentials are Torsen type, 
and the center differential is a regular, lockable type. There are at least 17 variants of the HMMWV in service with the United States 
Armed Forces. HMMWVs serve as cargo/troop carriers, automatic weapons platforms, ambulances (four litter patients or eight ambulatory 
patients), M220 TOW missile carriers, M119 howitzer prime movers, M1097 Avenger Pedestal Mounted Stinger platforms, MRQ-12 direct air 
support vehicles, S250 shelter carriers, and other roles. The HMMWV is capable of fording 2.5 ft (76 cm) normally, or 5 ft (1.5 m) with 
the deep-water fording kits installed.<br/><br/>
 
A HMMWV firing a TOW missile.Optional equipment includes a winch (maximum load capacity 6,000 lb (2,700 kg)) and supplemental armor. 
The M1025/M1026 and M1043/M1044 armament carriers provide mounting and firing capabilities for the M134 Minigun, the Mk 19 grenade 
launcher, the M2 heavy machine gun, the M240G/B machine gun and M249 LMG. The M1114 "up-armored" HMMWV, introduced in 2004, also features 
a similar weapons mount.[6] In addition, some M1114 and M1116 up-armored and M1117 Armored Security Vehicle models feature a Common
Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS), which allows the gunner to operate from inside the vehicle, and/or the Boomerang anti-sniper 
detection system. Recent improvements have also led to the development of the M1151 model, which is quickly rendering the previous 
models obsolete. By replacing the M1114, M1116, and earlier armored HMMWV types with a single model, the U.S. Army hopes to lower 
maintenance costs.<br/><br/>

<span class="subparagraph2">History:</span><br/>
In the 1970s, the United States Army concluded that the militarized civilian trucks in use no longer satisfied their requirements. In 1977, 
Lamborghini developed the Cheetah model in an attempt to meet the Army contract specifications. In 1979, the Army drafted final specifications
for a High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle, or HMMWV. In July of that year, AM General (a subsidiary of American Motors Corporation) 
began preliminary design work, and less than a year later, the first prototype, was in testing. In June 1981, the Army awarded AM General 
a contract for development of several more prototype vehicles to be delivered to the U.S. government for another series of tests, and the 
company was later awarded the initial production contract for 55,000 HMMWVs to be delivered in 1985.<br/><br/>

Ft. Lewis Washington and the 9th 
Infantry Division was the testing unit to employ HMMWV in the new concept of a Motorized Division to counter the Russian Motorized units. 
Yakima Training Center; Yakima, Washington was the main testing grounds of the HMMWVs from 1985 through December 1991, when the Motorized 
concept abandoned and the Division Deactivated. HMMWVs first saw combat in Operation Just Cause, the U.S. invasion of Panama in 1989. The 
HMMWV has become the vehicular backbone of U.S. forces around the world. Over 10,000 were employed by coalition forces during the 
Iraq War.';

The Ford MGM-51 Shillelagh was an American anti-tank guided missile designed to be launched from a conventional gun (cannon). It was originally intended 
to be the medium-range portion of a short, medium, long-range system for armored fighting vehicles in the 1960s and 70s to defeat future armor without 
an excessively large gun. Developing a system that could fire both shells and missiles reliably proved complex and largely unworkable. It served most 
notably as a primary weapon of the M551 Sheridan light tank, but the missile system was deleted from units serving in Vietnam. Ultimately very few of 
the 88,000 rounds produced were ever fired in combat.<br/><br/>

The Shillelagh was a disappointment compared to the later BGM-71 TOW anti-tank guided missile first produced in 1970 by the U.S. The TOW system, which 
could not fire gun rounds, and was guided by a wire which directly sent commands to the missile, proved simpler and more versatile. TOW became the most 
widely used anti-tank guided missile in the world based on a range of light, armoured and flying vehicles. Main battle tanks of the late 20th century 
such as the successful M1 Abrams tank fielded improved conventional 105mm and 120mm guns which proved effective against enemy armor threats. While the 
Russians are developing gun launched missiles, the US and NATO are developing guided tank shells. The name comes from a type of wooden club associated 
with Ireland.<br/><br/>

<span class="subparagraph2">Background:</span><br/>
With the rapid increase in armor during World War II, tanks were becoming increasingly able to survive rounds fired from even the largest of WWII-era 
anti-tank guns. A new generation of guns, notably the British 105 mm Royal Ordnance L7, were able to cope with newer tanks, but it appeared that in 
another generation the guns needed would be too large to be practical.<br/><br/>

Instead the US Army started concentrating on HEAT rounds in the 1950s. HEAT penetration is not dependent on the speed of the round, allowing it to be 
fired at much lower velocities, and thus from a much lighter gun. They also work better at larger diameters, and a large-diameter low-velocity gun makes 
for an excellent assault gun vehicle. On the downside, the low speed also means that they become increasingly hard to aim over longer distances. 
The US Army looked to address this problem with the use of HEAT-equipped guided missiles for anything beyond a few hundred yards.<br/><br/>

<span class="subparagraph2">Development:</span><br/>
In 1958 they felt the state of the art had progressed enough to start work on such designs, and in June 1959 Sperry and Ford Aeronutronic were asked 
for designs to fill the shorter range role. Ford won the contract and started work on the XM13. The first test shots occurred in 1960, and limited 
production started in 1964, now known as the MGM-51A. The basic system was quite advanced for its day. The missile body consisted of a long tube with 
fold-out fins at the extreme rear, which was propelled from the new M81 gun with a small charge strapped on the rear. Once clear of the gun the fins 
popped open and the engine ignited. In order to keep it from spinning while in the gun due to the rifling, a small "key" fit into a straight groove 
in the rifled gun. Aiming the missile was simple; the gunner simply kept his gunsight on the target, while electronics in the sighting system tracked 
the missile optically and sent corrections through an IR link (similar to a TV remote control). In general the gunners were able to achieve excellent 
hit ratios with the system.<br/><br/>

Because the system was so advanced, the development of the Shillelagh was fraught with problems. Ford Aeronutronic underestimated the complexity of 
the task of designing a missile this advanced, and there were major problems with the propellant, igniter, tracker and infrared command link of 
the missile.<br/>

<span class="subparagraph2">History:</span><br/>
The M1 Abrams was developed during the Cold War as a successor to the beleaguered MBT-70. The M1 Abrams contract went to Chrysler Defense and was 
the first vehicle to adopt Chobham armor. Adaptations prior to the Gulf War (Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm) gave the vehicle better
firepower and NBC protection. Being vastly superior to Iraqi tanks, very few M1 tanks were hit by enemy fire. Upgrades after the war improved the tanks 
weapons sights and fire control unit. The invasion of Iraq in 2003 destroyed Iraqs military. The subsequent insurgency exposed the tanks 
vulnerability to rocket-propelled grenades and mines. These problems were partially rectified with the TUSK kit. The Marine Corps sent a company of
M1 Abrams to Afghanistan in late 2010.<br/><br/>

<span class="subparagraph2">Development:</span><br/>
The first attempt to replace the aging M60 tank was the MBT-70, developed in partnership with West Germany in the 1960s. The MBT-70 was very ambitious, 
and had various ideas that ultimately proved unsuccessful. As a result of the imminent failure of this project, the U.S. Army introduced the XM803. 
This succeeded only in producing an expensive system with capabilities similar to the M60.<br/><br/>

Congress canceled the MBT-70 in November and XM803 December 1971, and redistributed the funds to the new XM815, later renamed the XM1 Abrams after 
General Creighton Abrams. Prototypes were delivered in 1976 by Chrysler Defense and General Motors armed with the license-built version of the 105 mm 
Royal Ordnance L7 gun along with a Leopard 2 for comparison. The turbine-powered Chrysler Defense design was selected for development as the M1; Chrysler 
had significant experience designing turbine-powered land vehicles going back to the 1950s. In 1981, General Dynamics Land Systems Division purchased 
Chrysler Defense.<br/><br/>

3,273 M1 Abrams were produced 1979-85 and first entered US Army service in 1980. It was armed with the license-built version of the 105 mm Royal 
Ordnance L7 gun. An improved model called the M1IP was produced briefly in 1984 and contained small upgrades. The M1IP models were used in the 
Canadian Army Trophy NATO tank gunnery competition in 1985 and 1987.<br/><br/>

About 6,000 M1A1 Abrams were produced from 1986–92 and featured the M256 120 mm (4.7 in) smoothbore cannon developed by Rheinmetall AG of Germany for 
the Leopard 2, improved armor, and a CBRN protection system. Production of M1 and M1A1 tanks totaled some 9,000 tanks at a cost of approximately
$4.30 million per unit.<br/><br/>

In 1990, Project on Government Oversight in a report criticized the M1s high costs and low fuel efficiency in comparison with other tanks of similar 
power and effectiveness such as the Leopard 2. The report was based on data from U.S. Army sources and the Congressional record. The government-owned
 Lima Army Tank Plant in Lima, Ohio, currently manufactures the Abrams, the Detroit Arsenal Tank Plant in Warren, Michigan manufactured it from 
 1982 to 1996. It costs upwards of US$5 million a tank.<br/><br/>

As the Abrams entered service in the 1980s, they operated alongside M60A3 within the United States military, and with other NATO tanks in numerous 
Cold War exercises. These exercises usually took place in Western Europe, especially West Germany, but also in some other countries, including 
South Korea. The exercises were aimed at countering Soviet forces. However, by 1991 the USSR had collapsed and the Abrams was instead employed 
in the Middle East.<br/><br/>';

The Leopard (or Leopard 1) is a main battle tank designed and produced in West Germany that first entered service in 1965. Developed in an era when 
HEAT warheads were thought to make conventional heavy armour of limited value, the Leopard focussed on firepower in the form of the German-built 
version of the British L7 105-mm gun, and improved cross-country performance that was unmatched by other designs of the era. The design started as a 
collaborative project between Germany and France in the 1950s,[1] but the partnership ended and the final design was ordered by the Bundeswehr, 
production starting in 1965. In total 6,485 Leopard tanks have been built, of which 4,744 were battle tanks and 1741 were utility and anti-aircraft
variants, not including eighty prototypes and pre-series vehicles.<br/><br/>

The Leopard quickly became a standard of European forces, and eventually served as the main battle tank in over a dozen countries worldwide. Since 
1990, the Leopard 1 has gradually been relegated to secondary roles in most armies. In the German Army, the Leopard 1 MBTs have been phased out in 
2003 while Leopard 1 derived vehicles are still widely used. The Leopard 2 MBTs have taken over the MBT role. Leopard hulls have been re-used in a 
wide variety of roles.<br/><br/>

<span class="subparagraph2">History:</span><br/>
The Leopard project started in November 1956 in order to develop a modern tank, the Standard-Panzer, to replace the Bundeswehrs American-built M47 
and M48 Patton tanks, which, though just delivered to West Germanys recently reconstituted army, were rapidly growing outdated. On 25 July 1957 
the detailed specifications were released; the new design needed to weigh no more than thirty metric tons, have a power-to-weight ratio of thirty 
horsepower per ton, be able to withstand hits by 20 mm rapid-fire guns on every side as well as operate in a battlefield contaminated with 
chemical weapons or radioactive fallout, the then-standard baseline for combat with the Warsaw Pact. In addition the main armament had to consist 
of a 105 mm caliber weapon (the new British L7A3 105 mm gun was selected), carrying at least as many rounds as current US tank designs. Mobility 
was the priority while firepower came second; armour was seen as less essential, as it was believed no real protection against hollow charge weapons 
was possible anyway.<br/><br/>
 
Leopard 1 prototypeFrance was very interested in the design as its own AMX 50 project had just failed. In June 1957, West Germany and the French 
Fourth Republic signed an agreement to develop a common tank, designated in German Europa-Panzer. Three German (Arbeitsgruppe A, B and C) and one 
French design team would be included in a competition, with each team producing two prototypes each. In September, 1958 Italy joined the 
development program. Several prototypes were entered for testing in 1960. Among the prototypes were Porsches Model 734 from team A, sporting a cast 
turret and that of team B (Rheinmetall) whose cast turret was somewhat higher. Team C from Borgward, designing a very futuristic tank, failed to
 have a prototype ready in time.<br/><br/>

Even before these first prototypes were finished, it had (in 1959) been decided that a second phase with improved designs would be started: Team A 
had to build 26 phase II Prototypes for testing, team B six. Only two tanks of the required six would actually be constructed by team B. Leopard 1 
Prototype IIThe Porsche Prototype II was eventually selected as the winner of the contest in 1963; this did not come as a surprise: it had already 
been decided in 1961 to build a preseries of fifty vehicles based on this design; production of these was started that very year. This "0-series" 
was modified with a new cast turret and several hull changes to raise the rear deck to provide more room in the engine compartment, and move some 
of the radiators to the upper sides of the hull. Before mass production of the standard version started it was also decided to add an optical 
range-finding system for better long-range gunnery, which required the turret to be somewhat taller, and added "bumps" on either side of the turret 
to mount the optics for triangulation. In 1963 France and Germany had decided to each build their own tank; Germany continued with the Leopard, 
while France built the similar AMX-30.<br/><br/>

Production was set up at Krauss-Maffei of Munich from early 1964 onward, with deliveries of the first batch between September, 1965 and July, 1966. 
The Leopard was soon being purchased from Germany by a number of NATO members and other allies including in chronological order Belgium (1968), 
the Netherlands (1969), Norway (1970), Italy (1971), Denmark (1976), Australia (1976), Canada (1978), Turkey (1980) and Greece (1981). Germany 
has a strict export policy for military equipment; Greece, Spain and Chile, while still dictatorships, purchased the French AMX-30.<br/><br/>';

The M198 howitzer is a medium-sized, towed artillery piece, developed for service with the United States Army and Marine Corps. It was commissioned 
to be a lightweight replacement for the WWII era M114 155mm howitzer. It was designed and prototyped at the Rock Island Arsenal in 1969 with firing 
tests beginning in 1970 and went in to full production there in 1978. It entered service in 1979 and since then 1,600 units have been produced and 
put into operation. The M198 is being replaced in US and Australian service by the BAE M777 howitzer, with deliveries underway.<br/><br/>

<span class="subparagraph2">Desciption:</span><br/>
The M198 155mm howitzer weighs under 16,000 pounds allowing it to be dropped by parachute or transported by a CH-53E Super Stallion or CH-47 Chinook. 
The M198 is a towed howitzer that is transported trail first, with the cannon resting above the weapons wheels. When firing, the weapon is lowered 
onto its baseplate rather than being anchored to the ground allowing for rapid emplacement. The breech is operated manually via a screw type mechanism 
that rests low in an ergonomic position. The M198 fires non-fixed ammunition and can be loaded with a variety of propellants and projectiles. The
 effective range 18,100 meters when firing standard projectiles and it increases to 30,000 meters when firing rocket assisted projectiles. With the
 52-caliber modification the range can surpass 40,000 meters. The weapon system requires a crew of 11 and is capable of firing at a maximum rate of 
 four rounds per minute, two sustained.<br/><br/>

The M198 is deployed in separate corps- and army-level field artillery units, as well as in artillery battalions of light and airborne divisions. It 
also provides field artillery fire support for all Marine Air-Ground Task Force organizations.<br/><br/>

<span class="subparagraph2">Capable munitions:</span><br/><br/>

<b>High Explosive (HE)</b><br/>
(M-107 NC/DC): Explosive Composition B material packed into a thick,internally-scored shell which causes a large blast and sends razor-sharp fragments 
at extreme velocities (5,000 - 6,000 meters per second). The kill zone is approximately a radius of 50 meters and casualty radius is 100 meters. The Marine
Corps and US Army also uses the M795 High Explosive round.<br/><br/>

<b>Rocket Assisted Projectile (RAP)</b><br/>
A rocket-assisted HE (also known as H.E.R.A.) round that adds to the maximum range of the normal HE. For the 155 mm RAP round, max range is 30.1
 kilometres (18.7 mi).<br/><br/>

<b>White Phosphorus (WP)</b><br/>
A base-ejecting projectile which can come in two versions: felt-wedge and standard. White phosphorus smoke is used to start fires, burn a target, or to
create smoke which is useful in concealing the movements of friendly units.<br/><br/>

<b>Illumination</b><br/>
Illumination projectiles are base-ejecting rounds which deploy a bright parachute flare ideally 600 meters above the ground and illuminates an area 
of approximately 1 grid square (1,000,000 square meters). Illumination rounds are often used in conjunction with HE rounds, to illuminate the target area 
so that HE rounds can be fired more effectively. Illumination rounds can also be used during the daytime to mark targets for aircraft. The M485 Illumination
round burns for 120 seconds.<br/><br/>

<b>Dual-Purpose Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM)</b><br/>
A base-ejecting projectile which drops 88 bomblets above a target. Each bomblet has a shaped-charge munition capable of penetrating two inches of solid 
steel as well as a fragmentation casing which is effective against infantry in the open. The DPICM round is effective against armored vehicles, even tanks 
(since the deck armor is usually the thinnest on the vehicle), and is also extremely useful against entrenched infantry in positions with overhead 
cover.<br/><br/>

<b>Area Denial Artillery Munition System (ADAMS)</b><br/>
An artillery round that releases anti-personnel mines. These mines eject tripwires to act as booby traps, and when triggered are launched upward before 
exploding. They are designed to self-destruct after a pre-determined period of time.<br/><br/>

<b>Remote Anti Armor Mine System (RAAMS)</b><br/>
An artillery round that releases anti-armor mines, usually used along with ADAMS rounds to prevent the antitank mines from being removed. Designed to 
self-destruct after a pre-determined period of time.<br/><br/>

<b>Copperhead</b><br/>
An artillery launched guided high explosive munition which is used for very precise targeting of high value targets such as tanks and fortifications. 
It requires the target be designated with a laser designator system. This round is currently no longer produced or used by the US military.<br/><br/>

<b>Sense and Destroy ARMor (SADARM)</b><br/>
An experimental munition which is fired in the general direction of an enemy vehicle. The shell activates at a certain point in time ejecting a 
parachute and then guides itself to the nearest vehicle.<br/><br/>

<span class="subparagraph2">Background:</span><br/>
Approximately the size of the U.S. Minuteman ICBM, the SS-25 carries a single-warhead atop a three stage system. The SS-25 is road mobile, making the missile inherently survivable and capable of reload/refire operations. It can fire from field deployment sites or through the sliding roof garage it occupies at its base. The SS-25 joined operational Soviet SRF regiments in 1985. A total area of approximately 190,000 square kilometers could be required to deploy a force consisting of 500 road-mobile SS-25 ICBMs. A much higher number of personnel for the maintenance of the mobile versions than for the fixed missiles, and the maintenance and operation of mobile ICBMs are significantly more expensive.
</br></br>
The three stage solid propellant RT-2PM Topol became the first Soviet mobile ICBM. It was deployed after almost two decades of unsuccessful attempts undertaken by different design bureaus. It emerged from the line of development of mobile missiles such as the SS-X-16 Temp-2S and the SS-20 Pioneer, and was deployed as a replacement for the widely deployed SS-11 SEGO.
</br></br>
All three stages are made of composite materials. During the first stage operation the flight control is implemented through four aerodynamic and four jet vanes. Four similar trellised aerodynamic surfaces serve for stabilization. During the second and third stage of flight gas is injected into the diverging part of the nozzle.With a throw-weight of 1000 kg the "Topol" carries a single warhead with a yield of 550 Kt and an accuracy (CEP) of 900m according to Russian sources [or 300m according to Western sources].
</br></br>
The missile is deployed in a transport-launch canister stationed on a mobile launch vehicle. The Transporter Erector Launcher is mounted on cross-country 7-axle chassis which incorprates jacks, gas and hydraulic drives and cylinders, with a power of several hundred tons, for jacking and leveling of the launcher, speeded up (combat) and slowed down (maintenance) elevation of the container with the missile to the vertical position. The TEL is accompanied by a Mobile command post, which carries support facilities mounted on cross-country 4-axle chassis with unified vans. The complex is equipped with an onboard inertial navigation system which provides a capability to conduct the launch independently from its field deployment sites. This topo-geodesic support and navigation subsystem, created by the ?Signal? Research Institute, provides a quick and highly precise tie-in of the launcher in a field position and enables its crew to carry out missile launches from any combat patrol route point. The launch can also be carried out at regimental bases from the garrison garage, which has a sliding roof.
</br></br>
The order to begin the development of this missile was approved on July 19, 1977 and carried out by the Moscow Institute of Thermal Technology headed by A. D. Nadiradzye. The flight tests were conducted on the Plesetsk test site from 08 February through 23 December 1985. During this period the battle management system constituted the main problem that had to be resolved. After the first test series was successfully conducted in April 1985, the first regiment with Topol missiles was put on 23 July 1985. Through this time work on improving the battle management system continued. The first regiment with "Topol"-missiles employing a modernized mobile command center (in area the of Irkutsk) were put on alert on 27 May 1988. The test missile firings were finally completed on 23 December 1987.
</br></br>
At the time of the signing of the Start-1 treaty in 1991 the Soviet Union had deployed some 288 Topol missiles. Deployment continued, and at the end of 1996 a total of 360 Topol missiles were deployed.
</br></br>
The Topol missile was deployed at previously developed deployment sites. After the INF-Treaty was signed in 1987 several SS-20 Pioneer deployment sites were adapted for the SS-25 Topol missiles. The United States expressed specific concerns during the INF treaty negotiations. When the SS-25 missile system was deployed in the field, with its missile inside the canister and mounted on the launcher, the US contended that the canister might conceal an SS-20 missile. The one distinguishing characteristic between the two systems, US treaty negotiators argued, was that the SS-25 had a single nuclear warhead, while the SS-20 had three warheads. After considerable discussion, the Soviet Union agreed to a provision in the treaty allowing the inspecting party the right to use radiation detection equipment to measure the fast neutron intensity flux emanating from the launch canister. A launch canister with a missile inside containing a single warhead (SS-25) emitted a different pattern of fast neutrons than did one with a missile having three warheads (SS-20). In the Memorandum of Agreement of 21 December 1989, the USSR and the U.S. agreed on procedures on how measurements would be taken during an on-site inspection.
</br></br>
As the provisions of the SALT-2 agreement prohibited the deployment of more than one new missile (which became RT-23UTTh), it was officially declared by the Soviet Union that the SS-25 Topol was developed to upgrade the silo based SS-13 RT-2P. The US government disputed this view, contending that the missile was clearly more than 5% larger and had twice the throw-weight as the SS-13.';

<span class="subparagraph2">Background:</span><br/>
The M80 Stiletto is a prototype naval ship manufactured by the M Ship Company as an operational experiment for The Pentagons Office of 
Force Transformation. It is notable for its hull design and carbon fiber construction, as well as its networked architecture.<br/><br/>

<span class="subparagraph2">Design:</span><br/>
The M80 Stiletto is a U.S. Navy vessel designed for combat in littoral (near shore) waters built by M Ship Co. It take the name from italian Stiletto 
the short knife or dagger. The 88-foot (27 m) long vessel has a notable hull design, an M-shaped hull that provides a stable yet fast platform for 
mounting electronic surveillance equipment or weapons, or for conducting special operations. The hull design does not require foils or lifting devices
to achieve a smooth ride at high speeds in rough conditions. Its shallow draft means the M80 Stiletto can operate in littoral and riverine environments
and potentially allows for beach landings.<br/><br/>

The M80 Stiletto is equipped with four Caterpillar, Inc. C32 1232 kW (1652 HP) engines yielding a top speed in excess of 50 knots (90 km/h) and a range 
of 500 nautical miles (900 km) when fully loaded. It can be outfitted with jet drives for shallow water operations and beaching. It has a topside flight 
deck for launching and retrieving UAVs and a rear ramp that can launch and recover an 11-meter rigid-hull inflatable boat (RIB) or Autonomous Underwater 
Vehicle (AUV).<br/><br/>

It weighs 45 tons unloaded, light enough that it can be hoisted onto a cargo ship, while still able to carry up to 20 tons of cargo in the 1,996 square 
feet (200 m2) of usable interior space. The ship is 88.6 feet (27.0 m) in length, with a width of 40 feet (12 m) and a height of 18.5 feet (5.6 m), yet
has a draft of only 2.5 feet (0.8 m). The M80 Stiletto is the largest U.S. naval vessel built using carbon-fiber composite and epoxy building techniques, 
which yields a very light but strong hull. The prototype M80 Stiletto is expected to be in use in less than one year. Ships are expected to cost between 
$6 and $10 million. Rear view of M80 Stiletto during a training of the Navy SEALs, 2006.<br/><br/>

Historically, ships have evolved to become narrower and deeper to achieve speed and stability. The M Hull however become wider, because its distinctively 
wide hull captures the vessels bow wave and redirects the energy under the hull. The Stilettos double-M hull enables the craft to achieve an unequaled 
ride in rough seas at high speed, which is critical for the Navy SEALS and other Special Operations Forces, because it reduces the G-forces and related
 injuries these personnel are subjected to during training and on missions.<br/><br/>

The Stiletto is being tested by the United States Navy SEALs and Special Warfare Combat Crewmen, who operate small, fast craft in in the rough littoral
seas that the vessel is designed to excel in. SEAL teams routinely endure 15-25 mile (24-40 km) trips through rough seas aboard their V-hulled boats 
and 11-meter RIBs, which can cause a variety of injuries to the spine, internal organs and extremities. However the M-Hull system, which produces 
an air cushion, reduces the chances of crew injuries through lower G-Force impact during transit.<br/><br/>

<span class="subparagraph2">History:</span><br/>
In 2006 and 2007, the Stiletto participated in Trident Warrior exercises, as well as a number of other naval exercises. This included three days of 
mine-clearing experimentation during Exercise Howler in 2006, when the vessel was operated by the Naval Special Clearance Team-1 (NSCT-1) from the Naval 
Amphibious Base in Coronado. A key feature of this vessel is that it can set up a network between a special forces team by launching an unmanned aerial 
vehicle (UAV) that relays information between the team and boat. The Stiletto can also carry surveillance UAVs to provide reconnaissance for the SEAL 
team, and, using a clustered supercomputer on board, will be able to send real-time images to the team on shore.<br/><br/>

The Stiletto was selected by Time magazine as one of the Best Inventions of 2006 and one of two inventions in the Armed Forces category. San Diego-based 
CONNECT named the M80 Stiletto as the Most Innovative New Product for 2006 in the General Technology category. In 2008, the Stiletto deployed on a 70 
day mission for USSOUTHCOM as part of a joint agency operation that included the Drug Enforcement Administration and U.S. Coast Guard.';

CA-2000 coastal submarine and the enlarged S-BR for the Brazilian Navy without AIP.<br/><br/>

The Chilean and Malaysian boats are fitted with the TSM 2233 Mk 2 sonar. The class can also be with an S-Cube sonar suite from Thales.
Air-independent propulsion The French MESMA (Module dEnergie Sous-Marine Autonome) system is being offered by the French shipyard DCN for 
the Scorpene class submarines. It is essentially a modified version of their nuclear propulsion system with heat being generated by ethanol 
and oxygen. A conventional steam turbine power plant powered by steam generated from the combustion of ethanol (grain alcohol) and stored 
oxygen at a pressure of 60 atmospheres. This pressure-firing allows exhaust carbon dioxide to be expelled overboard at any depth without 
an exhaust compressor.<br/><br/>

Each MESMA system costs around $50 a 60 million. As installed on the Scorpene, it requires adding a new 8.3 meter (27 foot), 305 tonne hull 
section to the submarine, and results in a submarine able to operate for greater than 21 days underwater, depending on variables like 
speed.';

<br/><br/>

<span class="subparagraph2">Background:</span><br/>

The Ohio class is a class of nuclear-powered submarines used by the United States Navy. The United States has 18 Ohio-class submarines: 14 nuclear-powered 
SSBNs (fleet ballistic missile submarines (FBM)), each armed with up to 24 Trident II SLBMs; they are also known as "Trident" submarines, and provide the
sea-based leg of the nuclear triad of the United States strategic nuclear weapons arsenal 4 nuclear-powered SSGNs (cruise missile submarines), each capable
of carrying 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles with either conventional or nuclear warheads.<br/><br/>

The Ohio class is named after the lead submarine of this class, the USS Ohio (SSGN-726) formerly designated SSBN-726. The 14 Trident II SSBNs together 
carry approximately fifty percent of the total US strategic warhead inventory. The exact number varies in an unpredictable and classified manner, at or 
below a maximum set by various strategic arms limitation treaties. Although the missiles have no pre-set targets when the submarine goes on patrol, 
the platform, when required, is capable of rapid targeting using secure and constant at-sea communications links.<br/><br/>

Ohio class submarines are the largest constructed for the U.S. Navy. Two classes of Russian submarines have larger total displacements: the Soviet-designed 
Typhoon-class submarines have more than twice the total displacement, and the Russian Federations Borei-class submarines have roughly 25% greater total 
displacement, but are shorter by 3 feet (0.91 m). Ohio class boats can carry more missiles and warheads than either.<br/><br/>

Ohios were specifically designed for extended deterrence patrols. Each submarine is complemented by two crews, Blue and Gold (standard practice for US FBMs),
 with each crew typically serving 70-90 day patrols. To decrease the time in port for crew turnover and replenishment, three large logistics hatches are 
 fitted to provide large diameter resupply and repair openings. These hatches allow rapid transfer of supply pallets, equipment replacement modules, and 
 machinery components, significantly reducing the time required for replenishment and maintenance.<br/><br/>

The class design allows the vessel to operate for over fifteen years between major overhauls. The boats are purported to be as quiet at their cruising 
speed of 20 knots (37 km/h; 23 mph) or more as previous subs were at 6 knots (11 km/h; 6.9 mph), although exact information remains classified.

Ohios were constructed from sections of hull, each four-deck section 42 ft (13 m) in diameter. The sections were produced at Quonset Point, Rhode 
Island, and assembled by Electric Boat at Groton. Fire control for the Mark 48 torpedoes is by Mark 118 Mod 2 system, while the Missile Fire 
Control (MFC) system is a Mark 98. Except for USS Henry M. Jackson (SSBN-730), the Ohio class submarines are named after states in the United States.<br/><br/>

<span class="subparagraph2">History:</span><br/>
The first eight Ohio class submarines were originally equipped with up to 24 Trident I (C4) submarine-launched ballistic missiles. Beginning with the 
ninth Trident submarine, USS Tennessee (SSBN-734), the remaining boats were equipped with the Trident II (D5). The Trident II missile carries eight 
multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs), in sum delivering more deterrence than the Trident I and with much greater accuracy. Starting 
with USS Alaska (SSBN-732) in 2000, the Navy began converting the remaining C4-equipped submarines to D5 missiles; this was completed in mid-2008.<br/><br/>

The first eight boats were homeported in Bangor, Washington to replace the Polaris (A3) carrying submarines that were then being decommissioned. 
The remaining ten boats were originally homeported in Kings Bay, Georgia, replacing the Atlantic-based Poseidon and Trident Backfit submarines. 
During the conversion of the first four hulls to SSGNs (see below), five boats, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Nebraska, Maine and Louisiana, were shifted 
from Kings Bay to Bangor. Further shifts are occurring as the United States strategic needs change.<br/><br/>

After the end of the Cold War, plans called for Ohio to be retired in 2002, followed by three of her sister ships. However, Ohio, Michigan, Florida and 
Georgia instead were slated for modification, to remain in service carrying conventionally-armed guided missiles, and were designated SSGNs.<br/><br/>

Beginning in 2002 through 2010, 22 of the 24 88 inches (2.2 m) diameter Trident missile tubes were modified to contain large vertical launch systems 
(VLS), one configuration of which may be a cluster of seven Tomahawk cruise missiles. In this configuration, the number of cruise missiles carried 
could be a maximum of 154, the equivalent of what is typically deployed in a surface battle group. Other payload possibilities include new generations 
of supersonic and hypersonic cruise missiles, and Submarine Launched Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles (SLIRBM), unmanned air vehicles (UAVs), 
the ADM-160 MALD, sensors for anti-submarine warfare or intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions, counter-mine warfare payloads such as 
the AN/BLQ-11 Long Term Mine Reconnaissance System (LMRS), and the broaching universal buoyant launcher (BUBL) and stealthy affordable capsule system 
(SACS) specialized payload canisters.<br/><br/>

The missile tubes also have room for stowage canisters that can extend the forward deployment time for special forces. The other two Trident tubes are 
converted to swimmer lockout chambers. For special operations, the Advanced SEAL Delivery System and the Dry Deck Shelter can be mounted on the lockout 
chamber and the boat will be able to host up to 66 special operations sailors or Marines, such as Navy SEALs. Improved communications equipment 
installed during the upgrade allows the SSGNs to serve as a forward-deployed, clandestine Small Combatant Joint Command Center.<br/><br/>

On 26 September 2002, the Navy awarded the Electric Boat company a $442.9 million contract to begin the first phase of the SSGN submarine conversion 
program. Those funds covered only the initial phase of conversion for the first two boats on the schedule. Advanced procurement was funded at $355 
million in fiscal year 2002, $825 million in the FY 2003 budget and, through the five-year defense budget plan, at $936 million in FY 2004, $505 
million in FY 2005, and $170 million in FY 2006. Thus, the total cost to refit the four boats is just under $700 million per vessel.<br/><br/>

In November 2002, the USS Ohio entered drydock, beginning her 36-month refueling and missile conversion overhaul. Electric Boat announced on 9 
January 2006 that the conversion had been completed. The converted Ohio rejoined the fleet in February 2006, followed by the USS Florida in April 
2006. The converted USS Michigan was delivered in November 2006. The converted Ohio went to sea for the first time in October 2007. The Georgia 
returned to the fleet in March 2008 at Kings Bay. These four SSGNs are expected to remain in service until about 2023-2026.';

<span class="subparagraph2">Background:</span><br/>
In the 1970s, the U.S. Air Force began looking for a replacement for its C-130 Hercules tactical cargo aircraft. The Advanced Medium STOL Transport 
(AMST) competition was held, with Boeing proposing the YC-14, and McDonnell Douglas proposing the YC-15. Though both entrants exceeded specified 
requirements, the AMST competition was canceled before a winner was selected. The Air Force started the C-X program in November 1979 to develop a larger 
AMST with longer range to augment its strategic airlift.<br/><br/>

By 1980, the USAF found itself with a large fleet of aging C-141 Starlifter cargo aircraft. Compounding matters, USAF needed increased strategic airlift 
capabilities to fulfill its rapid-deployment airlift requirements. The USAF set mission requirements and released a request for proposals (RFP) for C-X 
in October 1980. McDonnell Douglas elected to develop a new aircraft based on the YC-15; Boeing bid an enlarged three-engine version of its AMST YC-14. 
Lockheed submitted two designs, a C-5-based design and an enlarged C-141 design. On 28 August 1981, McDonnell Douglas was chosen to build its proposed 
aircraft, then designated C-17. Compared to the YC-15, the new aircraft differed in having swept wings, increased size, and more powerful engines. 
This would allow it to perform the work done by the C-141, and also fulfill some of the duties of the Lockheed C-5 Galaxy, freeing the C-5 fleet for 
outsize cargo.<br/><br/>

Alternate proposals were pursued to fill airlift needs after the C-X contest. These were lengthening of C-141As into C-141Bs, ordering more C-5s, 
continued purchases of KC-10s, and expansion of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet. Limited budgets reduced program funding, requiring a delay of four years. 
During this time contracts were awarded for preliminary design work and for the completion of engine certification. In December 1985 a full-scale 
development contract was awarded. At this time, first flight was planned for 1990. The Air Force had formed a requirement for 210 aircraft.<br/><br/>

Development problems and limited funding caused delays in the late 1980s. Criticisms were made of the developing aircraft and questions were raised 
about more cost-effective alternatives during this time. In April 1990, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney reduced the order from 210 to 120 aircraft.
The maiden flight of the C-17 took place on 15 September 1991 from the McDonnell Douglass plant in Long Beach, California, about a year behind schedule. 
The first aircraft (T-1) and five more production models (P1-P5) participated in extensive flight testing and evaluation at Edwards Air Force Base. 
Two complete airframes were built for static and repeated load testing.<br/><br/>

<span class="subparagraph2">Development:</span><br/>
A static test of the C-17 wing in October 1992 resulted in the wing failing at 128% of design limit load, which was below the 150% requirement. Both wings 
buckled rear to the front and failures occurred in stringers, spars and ribs. Some $100 million was spent to redesign the wing structure; the wing failed 
at 145% during a second test in September 1993. A careful review of the test data however, showed that the wing was not loaded correctly and did indeed 
meet the requirement.<br/><br/>

The C-17 received the "Globemaster III" name in early 1993. In late 1993, the Department of Defense gave the contractor two years to solve production 
and cost overrun problems or face termination of the contract after the delivery of the 40th aircraft. By accepting the 1993 terms, McDonnell Douglas 
incurred a loss of nearly US$1.5 billion on the development phase of the program. Vehicles and personnel unloading supplies from three gray C-17s parked 
together for victims of Hurricane Katrina. Three C-17s unload supplies to help victims of Hurricane Katrina at Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi, in
August 2005.<br/><br/>

In April 1994, the C-17 program remained over budget, and did not meet weight, fuel burn, payload and range specifications. It also failed several key 
criteria during tests to evaluate its airworthiness. There were technical problems with mission software, landing gear, and so on. In May 1994,
a proposal to cut the aircrafts production to as few as 32 aircraft emerged, but was rescinded. A July 1994 GAO document revealed that Air Force and DoD
studies from 1986 and 1991 stated the C-17 could use 6,400 more runways outside the U.S. than the C-5; it was later discovered that this study had only 
considered the runway dimensions, but not their strength or Load Classification Numbers (LCN). The C-5 has a lower LCN, but the USAF classify both in the 
same broad Load Classification Group (LCG). When considering runway dimensions and their load ratings, the C-17s worldwide runway advantage over the C-5 
shrank from 6,400 to 911 airfields. However, the C-17s ability to use lower quality, austere airfields was not considered.<br/><br/>

A January 1995 GAO report revealed that while the original C-17 budget was $41.8 billion for 210 aircraft, the 120 aircraft already ordered at that point 
had already cost $39.5 billion. In March 1994, the U.S. Army had decided it no longer needed the 60,000 lb (27,000 kg) Low Altitude Parachute Extraction 
System (LAPES) delivery with the C-17, feeling that the 42,000 lb (19,000 kg) capability of the C-130 was sufficient; C-17 testing was limited to this lower
weight. Issues with airflow prevented the C-17 from meeting its airdrop requirements. A February 1997 GAO report revealed that a C-17 with a full payload 
could not land on 3,000 ft (910 m) wet runways; simulations suggested 5,000 ft (1,500 m) was required.<br/><br/>

The YC-15 was transferred to AMARC to be made flightworthy again for further flight tests for the C-17 program in March 1997. By the mid-1990s, most of 
the problems had been resolved. The first C-17 squadron was declared operational by the U.S. Air Force in January 1995. In 1996, DoD ordered 
another 80 aircraft for a total of 120. In 1997 McDonnell Douglas merged with its former competitor, Boeing. In April 1999, Boeing proposed to cut the 
price of the C-17 if the Air Force bought 60 more, and in August 2002, the order was increased to 180 aircraft.';

<span class="subparagraph2">Development:</span><br/>
Development of the Saab 37 Viggen (Thunderbolt) began in the mid-1950s as Sweden began to seek a replacement for the Saab 32 Lansen attack aircraft. 
Guided by noted designer Aarne Lakomaa, Saab sought to create an effective aircraft that would meet Swedens unique strategic requirements. These included 
the ability to operate from short, improvised airstrips, such as reinforced roads, as well as be serviced and maintained by personnel with minimal training. 
In addition, the Swedish Air Force desired an aircraft capable of supersonic flight at low level and Mach 2.0 at high altitudes.<br/><br/>

In 1960, development of the new type was accelerated when Sweden concluded a defense agreement with the Eisenhower Administration which provided access to 
advanced American aeronautical technology. Having broken new ground with the double-delta wing on the early Saab 35 Draken, the company  again defied 
convention in its new design by creating an aircraft featuring a delta wing which was augmented by a set of canards. Though a radical approach, the design 
concept was approved on September 28, 1962 and Saab pushed forward with building a prototype. This flew for the first time on February 8, 1967.<br/><br/>

<span class="subparagraph2">Design:</span><br/>
Though Saab had originally wished to power the Viggen with the new Pratt & Whitney TF30 engine, it was not ready in time and designers instead chose the Volvo
RM8 turbofan. A militarized version of the Pratt & Whitney JT8D, it was equipped with both an afterburner and thrust reverser. The latter was added to allow the 
Viggen to use shorter, improvised runways and almost gave the aircraft short takeoff/landing (STOL) capabilities. Having chosen a large turbofan engine for its 
superior fuel efficiency, designers were forced to create a somewhat bulking airframe to accommodate it.<br/><br/>

A defining feature of the Viggen was the large canards which were mounted behind the cockpit and slightly higher than the wings. Though not movable, they 
provided additional lift and featured their own flaps. Due the aircrafts intended sphere of operations, its airframe featured a large amount of titanium for 
additional strength. In addition to its unique design, the Viggen broke new ground in regard to avionics by incorporating the first aircraft computer to use 
integrated circuits. Dubbed the CK 37, it could link to Swedish air  defense systems and was tied to the Viggens Ericsson PS 37 X-band monopulse radar.<br/><br/>

<span class="subparagraph2">Operational History & Variants:</span><br/>
Moving into production, 110 of the original AJ 37 Viggen design were built. Entering service on June 21, 1971, the first full squadron became active the 
following year. This was soon followed by a maritime strike and reconnaissance variant, dubbed the SH 37, which featured an optimized PS 371/A radar system. 
Twenty-six of this type were constructed, followed by the same number of a SF 37 reconnaissance variant. During the 1970s, work began to create a 
fighter/interceptor variant of the Viggen to complement the Saab 35 Draken.<br/><br/>

Designated the JA 37, this type possessed significantly enhanced avionics as well as a KCA 30mm Oerlikon cannon. Entering service in 1979, the JA 37 received 
numerous upgrades through its service life including the addition of encrypted data communication in 1985. This technology permitted the electronics of four 
fighters to be linked allowing one to designate a target for anothers missiles. Swedens use of this type of technology was far ahead of any other nation at 
the time.<br/><br/>

During the 1980s, Viggen pilots gained the distinction of being able to achieve missile lock on American SR-71 Blackbird reconnaissance aircraft. This was 
accomplished by analyzing the Mach 3+ planes predictable flight paths over the Baltic Sea. With the arrival of the new Saab JAS 39 Gripen in the late 1990s, 
the Viggen began to be phased out of Swedish service. The type was retired from frontline service in November 2005 with the last flight of any type occurring
two years later.<br/><br/>

Though a highly regarded aircraft, the Viggen was not purchased by any additional countries despite being offered for export. This lack of sales was largely 
the result of Swedens strict limits on arms exports to undemocratic regimes, international pressure against particular sales, as well as international pressure.';

In the late 1950s, Lockheed began preliminary development for a new spy plane to replace its earlier U-2. Overseen by Clarence "Kelly" Johnsons Skunk Works 
unit, the project sought an increase in speed while reducing the aircrafts radar cross-section. As it was intended for overflights of the Soviet Union, the 
aircraft was designed to travel at extremely high altitude at a speed in excess of Mach 3. This project ultimately produced the ground-breaking A-12 which 
was selected for service with the Central Intelligence Agency.<br/><br/>

In the early 1960s, the US Air Force began seeking a new aircraft for the reconnaissance/strike role. Though they considered using a modified version of the
XB-70 Valkyrie, they instead elected to pursue a variant of the CIAs A-12. Responding to the USAFs demands, Lockheed began a re-design of the A-12 which 
included a lengthening of the aircraft to increase range, the inclusion of a second seat in the cockpit, and an expansion of the sensor and camera capabilities.
These modifications also required altering the aircrafts distinctive chines.<br/><br/>

Initially dubbed R-12, the new type ultimately received the designation SR-71. Due to the aircrafts intended high speed, it was largely constructed of 
titanium to withstand the excessive temperatures that occur at supersonic speeds. In addition, as the SR-71s fuselage panels would expand due to the high 
operational temperatures, they were made to fit loosely when the aircraft was on the ground. As a result, it was known to leak fuel before takeoff. To power 
the SR-71, Lockheed installed two Pratt & Whitney J58 turbojets capable of generating 35,000 pounds of thrust each.<br/><br/>

Using specially-designed JP-7 jet fuel, the J58 featured a translating (moveable) spike in the intake to control airflow during flight. As speed increased, 
the spike retracted to increase the amount of air reaching the engine. As JP-7 was selected due to its high ignition point, a requirement in a high temperature 
flight, the SR-71 required an external engine and shots of triethylborane to start its engines. To ensure crew survivability at Mach 3+ and 80,000 feet, SR-71 
crews wore specially-designed full pressure suits during missions. These also provided vital protection in case of the need to eject.<br/><br/>

<span class="subparagraph2">Sensors & Instruments:</span><br/>
Due the nature of the SR-71s intended mission, pinpoint navigation was required. To meet this need, Lockheed utilized Northrops NAS-14/21 Astro-Inertial 
Navigation System which corrected inertial navigation errors with celestial observations. For fulfilling its mission, the SR-71 carried a wide array of cameras 
and sensors. These evolved over the aircrafts service life and included cameras, infrared imaging systems, side-looking radar, advanced synthetic aperture 
radar, and electronic intelligence gathering systems.<br/><br/>

<span class="subparagraph2">Operational History:</span><br/>
Dubbed the Blackbird, the first SR-71 flew on December 22, 1964. Production soon moved forward with Lockheed building 32 of the type. Entering service with 
the 4200th (late 9th) Strategic Reconnaissance Wing in January 1966, the SR-71 first deployed overseas in March 1968. Arriving at Kadena Air Base in Okinawa, 
the SR-71 conducted missions over North Vietnam during the Vietnam War. During the aircrafts time in Okinawa, its crews gave it the nickname Habu in reference
to a pit viper indigenous to the island.<br/><br/>

That same year, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara ordered the specialized tooling used to manufacture the aircraft destroyed. Though this was part of the 
original contract, it limited to Blackbird force to the 32 aircraft that had been built. The SR-71 remained in constant use by the USAF until 1989. Due to the 
nature of the aircrafts activities, the bulk of its missions remained classified. An expensive and difficult aircraft to maintain, the SR-71 never developed a 
dedicated support within the USAF or Congress. As a result, acquiring funding for the aircraft was difficult from the 1970s forward.<br/><br/>

Critics of the SR-71 typically cited the aircrafts cost and its lack of a data link which prevented the intelligence it gathered from being used in real time. 
In addition, parts were no longer available forcing ground crews to cannibalize other Blackbirds to keep a small number flying. Others questioned the need for 
the aircraft as reconnaissance satellites were developed to fulfill a similar role. This mix of justifications led to the aircraft being retired by the USAF 
in October 1989.<br/><br/>

This decision was questioned a year later when coalition forces were unable to obtain the type of intelligence the SR-71 could have provided during the Gulf 
War. Though not making a decision then, Congress began to reexamine the aircraft in 1993, especially as no effective replacement had been developed. As a 
result of the hearing, the SR-71 was re-activated. This move met some resistance from the USAF which had not planned for maintaining the aircraft and desired
to direct funding to other programs, including reconnaissance unmanned aerial vehicles.<br/><br/>

With the activation of the SR-71, Lockheed upgraded several airframes. Among the enhancements was the addition of a data link which could provide information 
in near real time. Rejoining the 9th Reconnaissance Wing, the SR-71s return proved short-lived. Facing resistance from the USAF and Clinton Administration, 
the Blackbird was permanently retired in late 1998. While the USAF quickly dispensed with the aircraft, NASA continued to fly two Blackbirds in a research 
role for another year.<br/><br/>

During its career, the SR-71 set several notable speed records including New York-London (1 hr., 54 min., 56.4 sec.), Los Angeles, Ca. to Washington, D.C. 
(64 min., 20 sec.), and West Coast to East Coast (67 min, 54 sec.). Also, in 1976 the SR-71 set an absolute altitude record by cruising at 85,069 as well 
as an absolute speed record of 2,193.2 mph. During its service life, no SR-71 was lost due to hostile action though numerous attempts were made. The standard
evasion maneuver for the aircraft was to simply accelerate to outrun the threat. In its career, twelve Blackbirds were lost in accidents resulting in one fatality.';

<span class="subparagraph2">Development:</span><br/>
As the 1960s progressed, the US Air Force was working to find a replacement for the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress. While still the services 
primary nuclear bomber, the aircraft was also in use during the Vietnam War dropping conventional munitions. With the failure of the 
XB-70 Valkyrie project, emphasis shifted towards the aircraft that would become the Rockwell B-1 Lancer. As work moved forward on this 
project in the early 1970s, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), began requesting information regarding technologies 
that could deflect or absorb radar signals. It was believed that if these technologies could be incorporated into an aircraft, it would 
be impervious to surface-to-air missiles and other radar-based methods of interception. Covertly approaching the aircraft industry in 1974,
DARPA selected McDonnell Douglas and Northrop to push forward developing a "stealth" bomber project.<br/><br/>

Also included in the discussions was Lockheed as the company had incorporated stealth features into its SR-71 Blackbird spy plane and was 
currently working on the stealth fighter project that would produce the F-117 Nighthawk. By 1976, Lockheeds stealth testing, as part of the 
Have Blue Project, led to the belief that a large stealth bomber could be created. Additional studies followed in 1978 and the following 
year the Advanced Technology Bomber (ATB) program was initiated. A fully black project, ATB received proposals from combined teams at 
Lockheed-Rockwell and Northrop-Boeing. In creating ATB designs, both teams elected to utilize a flying wing configuration. On October 
20, 1981, the design from Northrop was selected and designated B-2 Spirit.<br/><br/>

<span class="subparagraph2">Design:</span><br/>
Flown by a crew of two, Northrops design was powered by four General Electric F118-GE-100 engines which were situated deep within the 
B-2s wing to minimize their radar and infrared signatures. The B-2s minimal radar signature (approx. 0.1 square meter) was achieved 
through the use of a variety of composite materials, special coatings, and the aircrafts shape. By utilizing a flying wing design, 
Northrop eliminated many of the leading edges which could make the bomber visible to radar. Capable of flying approximately 6,900 miles,
the B-2 was designed for long duration missions and includes a toilet and small kitchen facility. As computers control many of the aircrafts
systems, only one crew member needs to be on duty at a time, allowing the other to sleep or perform other tasks. Possessing a large 
payload, the B-2 can carry up to eighty 500 lb. JDAM GPS-guided bombs or sixteen B83 nuclear bombs. In addition, it is capable of 
carrying a variety of standoff weapons such as cruise missiles. Targeting is aided by the aircrafts APQ-181 radar which can correct GPS
errors and increase accuracy. While a black project, existence of the B-2s development was hinted at by President Jimmy Carter during 
the 1980 presidential election. The aircraft was first publically displayed on November 22, 1988 at Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale, CA, 
with its first public flight taking place on July 17 of the following year.<br/><br/>

<span class="subparagraph2">Cost:</span><br/>
An immensely expensive project, the B-2 Spirit programs research and development cost was approximately $23 billion by the time it first 
flew in 1989. The US Air Force originally planned to acquire 132 aircraft, but this order was later reduced to 75. With the collapse of the
Soviet Union and end of the Cold War in 1991, the B-2 Spirits primary mission was eliminated. As a large fleet of nuclear bombers capable of 
penetrating Soviet airspace was no longer needed, President George H.W. Bush announced in 1992 that only twenty aircraft would be built. 
Four years later, it was decided to convert one of the prototypes into an operational aircraft for a cost of around $500 million which would 
increase the fleet to twenty-one.<br/><br/>

Throughout the 1990s, Northrop and advocates of the aircraft lobbied to increase B-2 fleet by an additional twenty aircraft. Possessing a 
procurement cost of $737 million per aircraft in 1997, the B-2 was deemed too expensive by many in Congress and the USAF leadership. 
Key military leaders argued against expansion stating that additional B-2 procurement would jeopardize their ability to continue to develop 
more conventional and versatile aircraft. Despite the Pentagons desire to halt production, the topic was hotly debated in Congress before 
procurement funding was finally cut. Though production was halted, funding has consistently been provided to update the existing fleet of 
B-2s.<br/><br/>

<span class="subparagraph2">History:</span><br/>
The first operational B-2 Spirit, Spirit of Missouri, was delivered to Whiteman Air Force Base, MO on December 17, 1993. Additional 
aircraft were delivered through November 1997 when the type officially became operational. Based at Whiteman, the B-2 fleet has proved 
expensive to maintain due to the complexity of the aircrafts systems and airframe, as well as its need to be housed in air-conditioned 
hangars to preserve its radar-reflecting/absorbing skin. In 1999, the B-2 became the second stealth aircraft to see combat (the F-117 
flew during the 1991 Gulf War) when it took part in Operation Allied Force over Kosovo. Flying long, non-stop missions from Whiteman, 
B-2s debuted GPS satellite-guided JDAM weapons and were responsible for destroying 33% of Serbian targets during the opening eight weeks 
of the conflict.<br/><br/>

In the wake of the 9/11 attacks, the B-2 began flying missions in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. With the beginning 
of the Iraq War in 2003, B-2s began flying strikes against Iraqi targets. These missions were launched from Whiteman as well as forward 
operating locations such as Diego Garcia, Andersen Air Force Base (Guam), and RAF Fairford (Britain). On February 23, 2008, a B-2 was lost 
after crashing during takeoff from Andersen Air Force Base. While the crew survived, the aircraft was a total loss. The cause of the crash 
was attributed to moisture in the aircrafts port transducer units during air data calibration which led to faulty information being sent 
to its onboard computers. Operated by the 509th Bomb Wing, the B-2 was shifted to the new Air Force Global Strike Command in late 2009. 
In March 2011, the B-2 returned to action as part of Operation Odyssey Dawn over Libya. Working to enforce an UN-mandated no-fly zone, 
three B-2s attacked a Libyan airfield near Sirte on March 20. These were the first US aircraft to take part in the conflict.';

<span class="subparagraph2">Background:</span><br/>
The first F-15A flight was made in July 1972, and the first flight of the two-seat F-15B (formerly TF-15A) trainer was made in July 1973. The first Eagle 
(F-15B) was delivered in November 1974. In January 1976, the first Eagle destined for a combat squadron was delivered. The single-seat F-15C and two-seat
F-15D models entered the Air Force inventory beginning in 1979. These new models have Production Eagle Package (PEP 2000) improvements, including 2,000 
pounds (900 kilograms) of additional internal fuel, provision for carrying exterior conformal fuel tanks and increased maximum takeoff weight of up to 
68,000 pounds (30,600 kilograms).<br/><br/>

The F-15 Multistage Improvement Program was initiated in February 1983, with the first production MSIP F-15C produced in 1985. Improvements included an 
upgraded central computer; a Programmable Armament Control Set, allowing for advanced versions of the AIM-7, AIM-9, and AIM-120A missiles; and an expanded 
Tactical Electronic Warfare System that provides improvements to the ALR-56C radar warning receiver and ALQ-135 countermeasure set. The final 43 included 
a Hughes APG-70 radar.<br/><br/>

F-15C, D and E models were deployed to the Persian Gulf in 1991 in support of Operation Desert Storm where they proved their superior combat capability 
with a confirmed 26:0 kill ratio. F-15 fighters accounted for 36 of the 39 Air Force air-to-air victories. F-15Es were operated mainly at night, hunting 
SCUD missile launchers and artillery sites using the LANTIRN system. They have since been deployed to support Operation Southern Watch, the patrolling of 
the UN-sanctioned no-fly zone in Southern Iraq; Operation Provide  Comfort in Turkey; in support of NATO operations in Bosnia, and recent air expeditionary 
force deployments.<br/><br/>

<span class="subparagraph2">History:</span><br/>
The F-15 Eagles history is long and distinguished. It began as a Air Force fighter study in the early 1960s and was known as the Fighter Experimental (FX). 
By 1967 the Air Force began development of a new high performance fighter aircraft that would be extremely agile and would be capable of gaining and maintaining 
air superiority through air-to-air combat. The new design had to be optimized for combat with the power and agility to overcome any current or projected Soviet 
threat. The F-15 was the first air-to-air fighter requested by the Air Force since the F-86 Sabre. The resulting F-15 Eagle had an unequaled combination 
of performance, firepower, and avionics. It was the benchmark--the plane to beat.<br/><br/>

To succeed in the air-to-air role, a plane needs the right airframe in combination with strong powerplant and avionics. The planes designers understood 
this and stretched technology to the limits. It was determined that a very low wing loading combined with heavy thrust from the engines would be required. 
U.S. fighter aircraft of the period were going faster (Mach 2 plus), but were heavy and lacked maneuverability compared to their Soviet counterparts. 
When combined with a capable airframe, better maneuverability can be achieved by maximizing thrust, thereby maximizing energy. The Pratt & Whitney F100 
Turbofan engine provides the needed thrust. Each engine is capable of producing 15,000 pounds of thrust at maximum power, and 25,000 pounds of thrust in 
afterburner. This gives the Eagle a total of 50,000 pounds of thrust. In other words, a nominally loaded F-15 Eagle of 48,000 pounds has a thrust-to-weight 
ratio of 1.04 pounds of thrust to each pound of aircraft weight. Thrust of this caliber allows an F-15 to accelerate while going straight up! A specially 
modified F-15A Eagle known as the "Streak Eagle" was able to outclimb a Saturn V Moon Rocket to almost 60,000 feet. This same aircraft flew to 98,430 feet
(30,000 meters) in 207.80 seconds (less than 3 minutes and 30 seconds).<br/><br/>

The lightly loaded airframe is combined with an equally impressive flight control system. A hydraulically actuated, mechanically controlled flight control
system is augmented by an electronic system known as the Control Augmentation System (CAS). This system takes the stick inputs from the pilot and deflects
the flight controls in the proper direction at the proper rate for optimal aircraft handling. This system allows the pilot to fly the aircraft to the 
limits of its capabilities without losing control of the aircraft. The CAS can also actuate the flight controls via pilot input if the hydro-mechanical
system is damaged.<br/><br/>

In order to win air-to-air battles, the pilot must be able to see, shoot, evade, and destroy the adversary first. The Eagle has an impressive array of
weapons and avionics which allow it to get the advantage. The APG-63 and 70 radars allow crews to see targets that are as far away as 100 miles. These 
"Eyes" are able to ferret out the targets even if the targets are flying at high speeds at low altitudes. A Tactical Electronic Warfare System (TEWS) 
lets the aircrew know if any threat is present. The Heads-up-Display (HUD), and the Hands on Throttle and Stick (HOTAS), allow the Pilot to select, 
track and shoot the adversary without having to look back into the cockpit.<br/><br/>

F-15 Morning AircraftThe impressive avionics suite is backed up by an equally impressive weapons capability. For close air-to-air combat the Eagle 
carries the six barreled 20mm M61A1 Vulcan cannon. The Vulcan fires rounds at rates of 66 or 100 rounds per second. Further distances are covered by 
the heat seeking AIM-9 Sidewinder, AIM-7 Sparrow, and the deadly AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile.<br/><br/>

The F-15 Eagle has been produced in five models. The single seat A and C models, the two seat B and D models, and the formidable F-15E Strike Eagle. 
The A through D models are air-to-air versions but the E Model can carry out an air-to-ground mission in addition to the original air-to-air mission.
The F-15E is capable of delivering over 20,000 pounds of air-to-ground ordinance while traveling at high speeds at very low altitudes (as low as 100 feet) 
at night. To perform this role the aircraft utilizes the sophisticated LANTIRN system (Low Altitude Navigation Targeting Infrared for Night). This 
multi-role aircraft was conceived early in the development of the F-15 because it was easier to convert a thoroughbred air-to-air fighter into a ground 
attack platform than to complete this function in the opposite manner. The rear cockpit has become a dedicated air-to-ground crew station, housing 
several sophisticated multi-function display screens and two hand controllers. Added fuel is carried in conformal side fuselage tanks that increase 
the range without adding excessive aircraft drag. These conformal fuel tanks, fully integrated into the aircraft structure, contain hard point 
stations for additional air-to-ground ordinance loads.<br/><br/>

<span class="subparagraph2">Features:</span><br/>
The Eagles air superiority is achieved through a mixture of unprecedented maneuverability and acceleration, range, weapons and avionics. It can penetrate 
enemy defense and outperform and outfight any current enemy aircraft. The F-15 has electronic systems and weaponry to detect, acquire, track and attack 
enemy aircraft while operating in friendly or enemy-controlled airspace. The weapons and flight control systems are designed so one person can safely 
and effectively perform air-to-air combat.<br/><br/>

The F-15s superior maneuverability and acceleration are achieved through high engine thrust-to-weight ratio and low wing loading. Low wing-loading 
(the ratio of aircraft weight to its wing area) is a vital factor in maneuverability and, combined with the high thrust-to-weight ratio, enables the 
aircraft to turn tightly without losing airspeed. A multimission avionics system sets the F-15 apart from other fighter aircraft. It includes a head-up 
display, advanced radar, inertial navigation system, flight instruments, ultrahigh frequency communications, tactical navigation system and instrument 
landing system. It also has an internally mounted, tactical electronic-warfare system, "identification friend or foe" system, electronic counter measures
set and a central digital computer.<br/><br/>

The head-up display projects on the windscreen all essential flight information gathered by the integrated avionics system. This display, visible 
in any light condition, provides the pilot information necessary to track and destroy an enemy aircraft without having to look down at cockpit 
instruments. The F-15s versatile pulse-Doppler radar system can look up at high-flying targets and down at low-flying targets without being confused by ground 
clutter. It can detect and track aircraft and small high-speed targets at distances beyond visual range down to close range, and at altitudes down 
to treetop level. The radar feeds target information into the central computer for effective weapons delivery. For close-in dogfights, the radar 
automatically acquires enemy aircraft, and this information is projected on the head-up display. The F-15s electronic warfare system provides both threat
warning and automatic countermeasures against selected threats.<br/><br/>

A variety of air-to-air weaponry can be carried by the F-15. An automated weapon system enables the pilot to perform aerial combat safely and effectively, 
using the head-up display and the avionics and weapons controls located on the engine throttles or control stick. When the pilot changes from one weapon 
system to another, visual guidance for the required weapon automatically appears on the head-up display. The Eagle can be armed with combinations of four 
different air-to-air weapons: AIM-7F/M Sparrow missiles or AIM-120 advanced medium range air-to-air missiles on its lower fuselage corners, AIM-9L/M 
Sidewinder or AIM-120 missiles on two pylons under the wings, and an internal 20mm Gatling gun in the right wing root.<br/><br/>

Low-drag, conformal fuel tanks were especially developed for the F-15C and D models. Conformal fuel tanks can be attached to the sides of the engine air 
intake trunks under each wing and are designed to the same load factors and airspeed limits as the basic aircraft. Each conformal fuel tank contains 
about 114 cubic feet of usable space. These tanks reduce the need for in-flight refueling on global missions and increase time in the combat area.
All external stations for munitions remain available with the tanks in use. AIM-7F/M Sparrow missiles, moreover, can be attached to the corners of 
the conformal fuel tanks.<br/><br/>

The F-15E is a two-seat, dual-role, totally integrated fighter for all-weather, air-to-air and deep interdiction missions. The rear cockpit is upgraded 
to include four multi-purpose CRT displays for aircraft systems and weapons management. The digital, triple-redundant Lear Siegler flight control system
permits coupled automatic terrain following, enhanced by a ring-laser gyro inertial navigation system. For low-altitude, high-speed penetration and 
precision attack on tactical targets at night or in adverse weather, the F-15E carries a high-resolution 
APG-70 radar and low-altitude navigation and targeting infrared for night pods.<br/><br/>';

<span class="subparagraph2">Background:</span><br/>
The F-16A, a single-seat model, first flew in December 1976. The first operational F-16A was delivered in January 1979 to the 388th Tactical Fighter Wing at 
Hill Air Force Base, Utah. The F-16B, a two-seat model, has tandem cockpits that are about the same size as the one in the A model. Its bubble canopy extends
to cover the second cockpit. To make room for the second cockpit, the forward fuselage fuel tank and avionics growth space were reduced. During training, 
the forward cockpit is used by a student pilot with an instructor pilot in the rear cockpit.<br/><br/>

All F-16s delivered since November 1981 have built-in structural and wiring provisions and systems architecture that permit expansion of the multirole 
flexibility to perform precision strike, night attack and beyond-visual-range interception missions. This improvement program led to the F-16C and F-16D 
aircraft, which are the single- and two-place counterparts to the F-16A/B, and incorporate the latest cockpit control and display technology. All active 
units and many Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve units have converted to the F-16C/D.<br/><br/>

The F-16 was built under an unusual agreement creating a consortium between the United States and four NATO countries: Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands 
and Norway. These countries jointly produced with the United States an initial 348 F-16s for their air forces. Final airframe assembly lines were 
located in Belgium and the Netherlands. The consortiums F-16s are assembled from components manufactured in all five countries. Belgium also provides final
assembly of the F100 engine used in the European F-16s. Recently, Portugal joined the consortium. The long-term benefits of this program will be technology 
transfer among the nations producing the F-16, and a common-use aircraft for NATO nations. This program increases the supply and availability of repair
parts in Europe and improves the F-16s combat readiness.<br/><br/>

USAF F-16 multi-mission fighters were deployed to the Persian Gulf in 1991 in support of Operation Desert Storm, where more sorties were flown than with 
any other aircraft. These fighters were used to attack airfields, military production facilities, Scud missiles sites and a variety of other targets.
Most recently in the Spring of 1999 during Operation Allied Force, USAF F-16 multi-mission fighters flew a variety of missions to include suppression of 
enemy air defense, offensive counter air, defensive counter air, close air support and forward air controller missions. Mission results were outstanding
as these fighters destroyed radar sites, vehicles, tanks, MiGs and buildings.<br/><br/>

<span class="subparagraph2">Features:</span><br/>
In an air combat role, the F-16s maneuverability and combat radius (distance it can fly to enter air combat, stay, fight and return) exceed that of all 
potential threat fighter aircraft. It can locate targets in all weather conditions and detect low flying aircraft in radar ground clutter. In an 
air-to-surface role, the F-16 can fly more than 500 miles (860 kilometers), deliver its weapons with superior accuracy, defend itself against enemy 
aircraft, and return to its starting point. An all-weather capability allows it to accurately deliver ordnance during non-visual bombing conditions.<br/><br/>

In designing the F-16, advanced aerospace science and proven reliable systems from other aircraft such as the F-15 and F-111 were selected. These were 
combined to simplify the airplane and reduce its size, purchase price, maintenance costs and weight. The light weight of the fuselage is achieved 
without reducing its strength. With a full load of internal fuel, the F-16 can withstand up to nine Gs -- nine times the force of gravity which 
exceeds the capability of other current fighter aircraft.<br/><br/>

The cockpit and its bubble canopy give the pilot unobstructed forward and upward vision, and greatly improved vision over the side and to the rear. The 
seat-back angle was expanded from the usual 13 degrees to 30 degrees, increasing pilot comfort and gravity force tolerance. The pilot has excellent 
flight control of the F-16 through its "fly-by-wire" system. Electrical wires relay commands, replacing the usual cables and linkage controls. For 
easy and accurate control of the aircraft during high G-force combat maneuvers, a side stick controller is used instead of the conventional center-mounted
stick. Hand pressure on the side stick controller sends electrical signals to actuators of flight control surfaces such as ailerons and rudder.<br/><br/>

Avionics systems include a highly accurate inertial navigation system in which a computer provides steering information to the pilot. The plane has 
UHF and VHF radios plus an instrument landing system. It also has a warning system and modular countermeasure pods to be used against airborne or 
surface electronic threats. The fuselage has space for additional avionics systems.<br/><br/>';

<span class="subparagraph2">Design & Development:</span><br/>
During the Vietnam War radar-guided surface-to-air missiles began to take an increasingly heavy toll on American aircraft. As a result of these losses, 
American planners began seeking a way to make an aircraft invisible to radar. The theory behind their efforts was initially developed by Russian mathematician
Pyotr Ya. Ufimtsev in 1964. Theorizing that the radar return of a given object was not related to its size but rather its edge configuration, he believed 
that he could calculate the radar cross-section across a wings surface and along its edge.<br/><br/>

Utilizing this knowledge, Ufimtsev conjectured that even a large aircraft could be made "stealthy." Unfortunately, any aircraft taking advantage of his 
theories would be inherently unstable. As the technology of the day was incapable of producing the flight computers necessary to compensate for this instability, 
his concepts were shelved. Several years later, an analyst at Lockheed came across a paper about Ufimtsevs theories and, as technology had sufficiently advanced, 
the company began developing a stealth aircraft based on the Russians work.<br/><br/>

Development of the F-117 began as a top secret "black project" at Lockheeds famed Advanced Development Projects unit, better known as the "Skunk Works." First 
developing a model of the new aircraft in 1975, dubbed the "Hopeless Diamond" due to its odd shape, Lockheed built two test aircraft under the Have Blue contract
to test the designs radar-defying properties. Smaller than the F-117, the Have Blue planes flew night test missions over the Nevada desert between 1977 and 1979. 
Utilizing the F-16s single-axis fly-by-wire system, the Have Blue planes solved the instability issues and were invisible to radar.<br/><br/>

Pleased with the programs results, the US Air Force issued a contract to Lockheed on November 1, 1978, for the design and production of a full-sized, stealth 
aircraft. Led by Skunk Works chief Ben Rich, with assistance from Bill Schroeder and Denys Overholser, the design team used specially designed software to 
create an aircraft which used facets (flat panels) to scatter over 99% of radar signals. The final result was an odd-looking aircraft that featured quadruple-
redundant fly-by-wire flight controls, an advanced inertial guidance system, and sophisticated GPS navigation.<br/><br/>

To minimize the aircrafts radar signature, designers were forced to exclude onboard radar as well as minimize the engine inlets, outlets, and thrust. The 
result was a subsonic attack bomber capable of carrying 5,000 lbs. of ordnance in an internal bay. Created under the Senior Trend Program, the new F-117 first 
flew on June 18, 1981, only a mere thirty-one months after moving into full-scale development. Designated the F-117A Nighthawk, the first production aircraft
was delivered the following year with operational capability reached in October 1983. All told 59 aircraft were built and delivered by 1990.<br/><br/>

<span class="subparagraph2">Operational History:</span><br/>
Due to the extreme secrecy of the F-117 program, the aircraft were first based at isolated Tonopah Test Range Airport in Nevada as part of the 4450th Tactical
Group. To aid in protecting the secret, official records at the time listed the 4450th as being based at Nellis Air Force Base and flying A-7 Corsair IIs. It 
was not until 1988 that the Air Force acknowledged the existence of the "stealth fighter" and released a fuzzy photograph of the aircraft. Two years later,
in April 1990, it was publically revealed when two F-117As arrived at Nellis during daylight hours.<br/><br/>

With the crisis in Kuwait developing that August, the F-117A, now assigned to the 37th Tactical Fighter Wing, deployed to the Middle East. Operation Desert 
Shield/Storm was the aircrafts first large-scale combat debut, though two had been secretly used as part of the invasion of Panama in 1989. A key component 
of the coalition air strategy, the F-117A flew 1,300 sorties during the Gulf War and struck 1,600 targets. The forty-two F-117As of the 37th TFW succeeded 
in scoring an 80% hit rate and were among the few aircraft cleared to strike targets in downtown Baghdad.<br/><br/>

Returning from the Gulf, the F-117A fleet was shifted to Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico in 1992, and became part of the 49th Fighter Wing. In 1999, 
the F-117A was used in the Kosovo War as part of Operation Allied Force. During the conflict, a F-117A flown by Lieutenant Colonel Dale Zelko was downed by 
a specially modified SA-3 Goa surface-to-air missile. Serbian forces were able to briefly detect the aircraft by operating their radar on unusually long 
wavelengths. Though Zelko was rescued, the remains of the aircraft were captured and some of the technology compromised.<br/><br/>

In the years since the September 11 attacks, the F-117A has flown combat missions in support of both Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. In the 
latter case, it dropped the opening bombs of the war when F-117s struck a leadership target in the conflicts opening hours in March 2003. Though a highly 
successful aircraft, the F-117As technology was becoming outmoded by 2005 and maintenance costs were rising. With the introduction of the F-22 Raptor and 
development of the F-35 Lightning II, Program Budget Decision 720 (issued December 28, 2005) proposed retiring the F-117A fleet by October 2008. Though 
the US Air Force had intended to keep the aircraft in service until 2011, it decided to begin retiring it to enable the purchase of additional F-22s.<br/><br/>

Due to the sensitive nature of the F-117A, it was decided to retire the aircraft to its original base at Tonopah where they would be partially disassembled 
and placed in storage. While the first F-117As left the fleet in March 2007, the final aircraft departed active service on April 22, 2008. That same day 
official retirement ceremonies were held. Four F-117As remained in brief service with the 410th Flight Test Squadron at Palmdale, CA and were taken to 
Tonopah in August 2008.<br/><br/>';

<span class="subparagraph2">Origins:</span><br/>
The F-14 program commenced following the US Navys withdrawal from the Tactical Fighter Experimental (TFX) Program in 1968. Designed to create a joint aircraft for both the US Navy 
and Air Force use, the TFX program ultimately produced the F-111. When it became clear that the TFX would not be able to fulfill the Navys need for a fleet air defense fighter, it 
requested permission to terminate its part of the program. This was granted in May 1968, and a request for proposals was issued for a tandem two-seat fighter capable of Mach 2.2 and 
fulfilling a secondary close air support role.<br/><br/>

The Navy received responses from five companies and in December 1968, chose Grumman and McDonnell Douglas as the finalists. Both designs incorporated variable geometry wings 
(swing wings) similar to the F-111. After further review, the contract was awarded to Grumman in January 1969. In an effort to avoid interference from the Defense Department, 
the Navy skipped the prototype phase and pushed the program directly to full-scale development. Expanding its Calverton, Long Island plant, Grumman tested and refined the design 
with the first aircraft flying December 21, 1970.<br/><br/>

<span class="subparagraph2">Design:</span><br/>
The first American fighter to incorporate the lessons learned in the skies over Vietnam, the F-14 was meant to be a long-range interceptor capable of interdicting strikes against 
\American carrier groups as well as an agile air superiority fighter. To accomplish these missions, the aircraft was designed to fire the long-range AIM-54 Phoenix missile, but also 
carried shorter range air-to-air missiles such as the AIM-9 Sidewinder and AIM-7 Sparrow. In addition, it was fitted with the M61 Vulcan gun.<br/><br/>

Initially powered by two Pratt & Whitney TF30 engines, the aircraft was intended to receive the F100 shortly after production began. This upgrade did not occur and it was not until 
1987, that the F-14s engines were significantly improved. A key element of the aircrafts design was its variable geometry wings. Able to move between 20 and 68 in flight, they were
controlled by the F-14s air data computer. Typically, they were swept forward to allow the aircraft to turn tightly in a dogfight and swept back during high-speed intercepts.<br/><br/>

The F-14 received its first upgrade in 1987, with the introduction of the F-14B. This new model utilized the GE F110-400 engine which was a significant improvement over the TF30. 
In addition, the F-14B possessed superior avionics and electronic countermeasures to its predecessor. A second upgrade came in 1991, with the arrival of the F-14D. Meant to replace 
all other F-14s in the fleet, the D-model was only produced in limited quantities after the program was cut back. With the retirement of the A-6 Intruder, the F-14 was first adapted 
for a ground-strike role in 1994, through the use of a LANTRIN pod.<br/><br/>

<span class="subparagraph2">Operational History:</span><br/>
Joining the fleet in September 1974, the F-14 replaced the F-4 Phantom II. First serving aboard USS Enterprise, the aircraft aided in covering the American withdrawal from Saigon. 
Six years later, the F-14 first saw combat over the Gulf of Sidra on August 19, 1981. Engaged by two Libyan Su-22s, F-14s from VF-41 downed both aircraft. Seven years later, two F-14s 
from VF-32 shot down two Libyan MiG-23s over the same waters. Though intended as an air superiority fighter, the F-14 saw its first extended combat use as a photo reconnaissance aircraft.<br/><br/>

With the retirement of dedicated reconnaissance aircraft, such as the RA-5C Vigilante, the F-14 was selected to fill the void. Equipped with a Tactical Airborne Reconnaissance Pod System 
(TARPS) controlled by the aircrafts radar intercept officer, the F-14 began flying reconnaissance missions over Lebanons Bekaa Valley in the early 1980s. Developing high-speed, medium 
altitude tactics for the mission, F-14 air crews proved highly adept in the reconnaissance role.<br/><br/>

In 1991, the F-14 returned to its traditional mission as part of Operation Desert Storm. Initially, the Tomcat was limited to combat air patrols and escorting strike aircraft as 
overland air superiority had been assigned to Air Force F-15s. It was during this conflict that the only F-14 lost to enemy action was downed when one was struck by an SA-2 surface-to-air 
missile. While the pilot was rescued, the RIO was taken prisoner by the Iraqis. Operation Desert Storm saw the F-14 achieve its final air-to-air kill when one shot down a Mi-8 helicopter 
with an AIM-9 Sidewinder.<br/><br/>

Following Desert Storm, the F-14 saw action during the 1995 and 1999 NATO operations over the former Yugoslavia. Sandwiched between these was participation in the Operation Desert Fox 
in Iraq (1998). In the wake of 9/11, the F-14 led several of the first strikes into Afghanistan in the opening hours of Operation Enduring Freedom. It subsequently saw service over Iraq 
as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom.<br/><br/>

<span class="subparagraph2">Retirement:</span><br/>
In 1994, Grumman first approached the Navy regarding building out the F-14 past the "D" model. Though the Navy was interested, Congress denied funding and the decision was made to retire 
the aircraft. The F-14s fleet defense role was passed to the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. As a result the F-14 was slowly eased out of service with its last combat flight coming on February 
8, 2006. A few weeks later, on March 10, the final two F-14 squadrons returned from deployment when USS Theodore Roosevelts air group flew into Naval Air Station Oceana. At this time the 
only country to still operate the F-14 is Iran. These were sold to the Middle Eastern nation in the 1970s prior to the fall of the Shah. As a result of Irans use of the aircraft, retired 
US F-14s are being destroyed to ensure that spare parts are not available for Iranian use.';

<span class="subparagraph2">Design & Development:</span><br/>
On November 23, 1945, only weeks after the end of World War II, the US Air Material Command issued performance specifications for a new long-range, nuclear bomber. Calling for a cruising 
speed of 300 mph and a combat radius of 5,000 miles, AMC invited bids the following February from Martin, Boeing, and Consolidated. Developing the Model 462, a straight-wing bomber powered
by six turboprops, Boeing was able to win the competition despite the fact that the aircrafts range fell short of the specifications. Moving forward, Boeing was issued a contract on 
June 28, 1946, to build a mock-up of the new XB-52 bomber.<br/><br/>

Over the next year, Boeing was forced to change the design several times as the US Air Force first showed concern over the XB-52s size and then increased the required cruising speed. By 
June 1947, the USAF realized that when complete the new aircraft would nearly be obsolete. While the project was put on hold, Boeing continued to refine their latest design. That September,
the Heavy Bombardment Committee issued new performance requirements demanding 500 mph and an 8,000-mile range, both of which were far beyond Boeings latest design.<br/><br/>

Lobbying hard, the president of Boeing, William McPherson Allen, was able to prevent their contract from being terminated. Coming to an accord with the USAF, Boeing was instructed to begin
exploring recent technological advances with an eye to incorporating them into the XB-52 program. Moving forward, Boeing presented a new design in April 1948, but was told the next month 
that the new aircraft should incorporate jet engines. After swapping out turboprops for jets on their Model 464-40, Boeing was ordered to design a completely new aircraft utilizing the 
Pratt & Whitney J57 turbojet on October 21, 1948.<br/><br/>

A week later, Boeing engineers first tested the design that would become the basis for the final aircraft. Possessing 35-degree swept wings, the new XB-52 design was powered by eight 
engines placed in four pods under the wings. During testing, concerns arose regarding the fuel consumption of the engines, however the commander of the Strategic Air Command, General 
Curtis LeMay insisted the program move forward. Two prototypes were built and the first flew on April 15, 1952, with famed test pilot Alvin "Tex" Johnston at the controls. Pleased with 
the result, the USAF placed an order for 282 aircraft.<br/><br/>

<span class="subparagraph2">Operational History:</span><br/>
Entering operational service in 1955, the B-52B Stratofortress replaced the Convair B-36 Peacemaker. During its initial years of service, several minor issues arose with the aircraft 
and the J57 engines experienced reliability problems. A year later, the B-52 dropped its first hydrogen bomb during testing at Bikini Atoll. On January 16-18, 1957, the USAF demonstrated 
the bombers reach by having three B-52s fly non-stop around the world. As additional aircraft were built, numerous changes and modifications were made. In 1963, the Strategic Air Command
fielded a force of 650 B-52s.<br/><br/>

With the US entry into the Vietnam War, the B-52 saw its first combat missions as part of Operations Rolling Thunder (March 1965) and Arc Light (June 1965). Later that year, several
B-52Ds underwent "Big Belly" modifications to facilitate the aircrafts use in carpet bombing. Flying from bases in Guam, Okinawa, and Thailand, B-52s were able to unleash devastating 
firepower on their targets. It was not until November 22, 1972, that the first B-52 was lost to enemy fire when an aircraft was downed by a surface-to-air missile.<br/><br/>

The B-52s most notable role in Vietnam was during Operation Linebacker II in December 1972, when waves of bombers struck targets across North Vietnam. During the war, 18 B-52s were 
lost to enemy fire and 13 to operational causes. While many B-52s saw action over Vietnam, the aircraft continued to fulfill its nuclear deterrence role. B-52s routinely flew airborne
alert missions to provide a rapid first strike or retaliation capability in case of war with the Soviet Union. These missions ended in 1966, following the collision of a B-52 and a 
KC-135 over Spain.<br/><br/>

During the 1973 Yom Kippur War between Israel, Egypt, and Syria, B-52 squadrons were placed on a war footing in an effort to prevent the Soviet Union from becoming involved in the 
conflict. By the early 1970s, many of the early variants of the B-52 began to be retired. With the B-52 aging, the USAF sought to replace the aircraft with the B-1B Lancer, however
strategic concerns and cost issues prevented this from occurring. As a result, B-52Gs and B-52Hs remained a part of the Strategic Air Commands nuclear standby force until 1991.<br/><br/>

With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the B-52G was removed from service and the aircraft destroyed as part of the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty. With the launch of the coalition 
air campaign during the 1991 Gulf War, the B-52H returned to combat service. Flying from bases in the United States, Britain, Spain, and Diego Garcia, B-52s conducted both close air 
support and strategic bombing missions, as well as served as a launch platform for cruise missiles. Carpet bombing strikes by B-52s proved particularly effective and the aircraft 
was responsible for 40% of the munitions dropped on Iraqi forces during the war.<br/><br/>

In 2001, the B-52 again returned to the Middle East in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. Due to the aircrafts long loiter time, it proved highly effective in providing needed 
close air support to the troops on the ground. It has fulfilled a similar role over Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom. As of April 2008, the USAFs B-52 fleet consisted of 94 B-52Hs 
which operate from Minot (North Dakota) and Barksdale (Louisiana) Air Force Bases. An economical aircraft, the USAF intends to retain the B-52 through 2040 and has investigated several
options for updating and enhancing the bomber, including replacing its eight engines with four Rolls-Royce RB211 534E-4 engines.';

<span class="subparagraph2">Design & Development:</span><br/>
The F-35 Lightning II was developed as a result of the Joint Strike Fighter Program. Begun in the mid-1990s, the JSF program was designed to produce a new 
multi-role aircraft that would be capable of replacing several aircraft currently in use. In 1995, the United Kingdom joined the project and began to 
contribute towards the aircrafts development costs. All prospective designs were required to be capable of conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL), carrier 
takeoff and landing (CV variant), and short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL).<br/><br/>

On November 16, 1996, contracts to develop prototypes were granted to Lockheed Martin and Boeing. A bid from McDonnell-Douglas was rejected due to the 
complexity of their proposed design. Moving forward, Lockheed Martin and Boeing each constructed prototypes of their designs, the X-35 and X-32. During 
the JSF flight testing competition, the X-35 consistently bettered the X-32, with the coupe de grace coming when the X-35B (STOVL variant) took off in 
less than 500 ft., accelerated to supersonic speed, then landed vertically. Boeings X-32 was unable to accomplish this feat.<br/><br/>

<span class="subparagraph2">Design & Production:</span><br/>
On October 26, 2001, the Department of Defense awarded the contract for system development and demonstration to Lockheed Martin. A key reason for this 
was the X-35Bs method for achieving STOVL flight which utilizes a lift fan system rather than the vector thrust system used by other similar aircraft 
such as the AV-8. In appearance, the F-35 is evocative of the F-22 Raptor, also built by Lockheed Martin, and incorporates stealth technology into its 
design. The aircraft also includes high-speed networking, cockpit-speech recognition, and helmet-mounted displays in place of the traditional heads-up 
display.<br/><br/>

To improve the pilots situational awareness, the F-35 incorporates integrated avionics and sensors capable of relaying data from other air and ground 
sources. The heart of the aircrafts sensors will be the Northrop Grumman AN/APG-81 AESA-radar, augmented by the Lockheed Martin/BAE Systems Electro-Optical 
Targeting System. As the primary contactor, Lockheed Martin will oversee the final assembly and systems integration of the aircraft. For those aircraft 
sold to European (non-UK) nations, final assembly will be conducted by the Italian firm Alenia. The aircraft was named in honor of the famed P-38 
Lightning.<br/><br/>

<span class="subparagraph2">Variants:</span><br/>

The F-35 will be produced in three variants:<br/><br/>

F-35A: The conventional takeoff/landing version of the aircraft, the F-35A will largely be employed by air forces. Highly maneuverable and possessing a 
large weapons capacity, the F-35A will replace both the F-16 Fighting Falcon and A-10 Thunderbolt in the US Air Force inventory. The F-35A is the only 
variant to incorporate an internal gun. The F-35A should enter service in 2011.<br/><br/>

F-35B: The STVOL version of the aircraft, the F-35B incorporates a Rolls-Royce Lift Fan module and a vectoring cruise nozzle which permits the aircraft
 to achieve vertical flight. As a result of the STVOL equipment, the F-35B possesses the smallest internal weapons capacity of the three variants. It is
 intended to replace the US Marine Corps AV-8B Harrier II and the British Harrier GR7/GR9. This variant is scheduled to enter service in 2012.<br/><br/>

F-35C: Designed for the US Navy, the F-35C is the carrier variant of the aircraft. Possessing larger folding wings and reinforced landing gear, the aircraft
 is capable of a longer range than the F-35A and F-35B. The US Navy plans to use the aircraft to replace the F/A-18/A/B/C/D Hornet and as a complement 
 to the F/A-18 Super Hornet. The F-35C should enter service in 2012.<br/><br/>

<span class="subparagraph2">International Cooperations:</span><br/>

The development of the F-35 JSF was a multi-national effort which incorporated nine different international partners at different levels. Combined these 
partners anticipate purchasing 3,100 F-35s, making it one of the worlds most numerous fighter aircraft. Spearheaded by the United States, the projects 
second largest partner was the United Kingdom which contributed over $2.5 billion (10% of development costs) to the project. Level 2 partners include 
Italy and the Netherlands who have contributed $1 billion and $800 million respectively. Third tier partners are Canada ($440 million), Turkey ($175 
million), Australia ($144 million), Norway ($122 million), and Denmark ($110 million). While the project has largely gone smoothly, there have been 
issues regarding technology transfer and industrial share.<br/><br/>';

<span class="subparagraph2">General:</span><br/>
The F-22 Raptor fighter jet has been jointly designed and built by Lockheed Martin Corp. and the Boeing Company. The aircraft first entered service
with the U.S. Air Force in 2005 after nearly 20 years of development. Despite the long development phase, the F-22 Raptor has quickly earned a sterling 
reputation in military and aviation circles around the world for its superior speed, manoeuvrability, situational awareness, and its combat capabilities.
In 2004, Angus Houston, Chief of the Australian Defense Force, called the F-22 Raptor The most outstanding fighter plane ever built.<br/><br/>

The U.S. Air Force has been equally complimentary about the F-22 Raptor, claiming that it is the best all around fighter jet in the world, and that it 
is critical to the U.S. Air Forces tactical air power - now and into the future. The U.S. military is spending $65 billion to acquire 187 F-22 Raptor 
fighter jets. At the end of 2010, 170 of the aircraft had been delivered to the U.S. Air Force and are being used primarily in homeland defense 
operations. The F-22 Raptor has not been put into service in Iraq or Afghanistan.<br/><br/>

The F-22 Raptor fighter jet has been developed exclusively for the U.S. Air Force. Export sales of the F-22 Raptor are banned by U.S. federal law, and
much of the aircrafts technology and capabilities are classified information. Military allies of the U.S. such as Canada and Australia are purchasing 
the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft, which has some of the same technology and parts as the F-22 Raptor. However, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter 
is not as quick, nimble or advanced as the F-22 Raptor. The F-22 is a superior fighter jet.<br/><br/>

What distinguishes the F-22 Raptor from other fighter jets is the combination of speeds that exceed Mach 2.0 - more than 1,300 miles per hour - 
exceptional agility, stealth technology, and the most advanced avionics ever developed. When combined, these characteristics make the F-22 Raptor 
an exceptional overall fighter jet. The aircraft has a single seat and twin afterburning Pratt & Whitney F119-PW-100 turbofan engines. For weapons, 
the F-22 Raptor is outfitted with a 20 millimeter M61A2 Vulcan Gatling gun that can carry 480 rounds of ammunition, two AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles, 
eight 250 pound GBU-39 small diameter bombs, and two 1,000 pound JDAM bombs.';

<span class="subparagraph2">Background:</span><br/>
Submarine launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) have been an integral part of the strategic deterrent for six generations, starting in 
1956 with the U.S. Navy Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM) Polaris (A1) program. Since then, the SLBM has evolved through Polaris (A2), 
Polaris (A3), Poseidon (C3) and todays force of Trident I (C4) and Trident II (D5). Each generation has been continuously deployed at 
sea as a survivable retaliatory force and has been routinely operationally tested and evaluated to maintain confidence and credibility 
in the deterrent.<br/><br/>

Trident I (C4) was first deployed in 1979 and is planned to be deployed until phased out in the early 2000s. Trident II (D5) was first 
deployed in 1990 and is planned to be deployed past 2020. The Trident II (D5) missile is also provided to the United Kingdom which equips 
the missile with UK warheads and deploys the missile on Vanguard Class UK submarines.<br/><br/>

<span class="subparagraph2">Features:</span><br/>
Trident I (C4) and Trident II (D5) missiles are deployed in Ohio- class (Trident) submarines, each carrying 24 missiles. The Trident II (D5) 
is a three-stage, solid-propellant, inertially guided FBM with a range of more than 4,000 nautical miles (4,600 statute miles). Trident II
is more sophisticated than Trident I (C4) with a significantly greater payload capability. All three stages of the Trident II are made of 
lighter, stronger, stiffer graphite epoxy, whose integrated structure means considerable weight saving.<br/><br/>

The missile range is increased by 
the aerospike, a telescoping outward extension that reduces frontal drag by about 50 percent. Trident II is launched by the pressure of 
expanding gas within the launch tube. When the missile attains sufficient distance from the submarine, the first stage motor ignites, the 
aerospike extends and the boost stage begins. Within about two minutes, after the third stage motor kicks in, the missile is traveling in 
excess of 20,000 feet (6,096 meters) per second.';
